.. _CONFIG_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C:

Use atomic operations routines that are implemented entirely
in C by locking interrupts. Selected by architectures which either
do not have support for atomic operations in their instruction
set, or haven't been implemented yet during bring-up, and also
the compiler does not have support for the atomic __sync_* builtins.
