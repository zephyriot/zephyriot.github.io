Says y if you want to use external 32 kHz crystal
oscillator to drive the slow clock. Note that this
adds a few seconds to boot time, as the crystal
needs to stabilize after power-up.

Says n if you do not need accraute and precise timers.
The slow clock will be driven by the internal fast
RC oscillator running at 32 kHz.
