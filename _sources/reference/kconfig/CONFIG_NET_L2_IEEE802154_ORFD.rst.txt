This is a TEST ONLY support. Do not use that in production!
This is not spec compliant. This is added for 2 reasons:
to support legacy stack behavior and for testing. PAN ID is fixed
as well as the channel. The device is not able to scan, associate
to a PAN or anything else like that. You have been warned.
