Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx
microcontrollers.  They are intended for applications where
connectivity and real-time performances are required such as
industrial control, control panels for security applications, UPS or
home audio.  For STM32F107xx also the Ethernet MAC is available.
