.. option:: CONFIG_EARLY_CONSOLE:
.. _CONFIG_EARLY_CONSOLE:

This option will enable stdout as early as possible, for debugging
purpose. For instance, in case of STDOUT_CONSOLE being set it will
initialize its driver earlier than normal, in order to get the stdout
sent through the console at the earliest stage possible.
