.. title:: NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES

.. option:: CONFIG_NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES:
.. _CONFIG_NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES:

Number of preemptible priorities available in the system. Gives access
to priorities 0 to CONFIG_NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES - 1.

This can be set to 0 to disable preemptible scheduling.

Each priority requires an extra 8 bytes of RAM. Each set of 32 extra
total priorities require an extra 4 bytes and add one possible
iteration to loops that search for the next thread to run.

The total number of priorities is

   NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES + NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES + 1

The extra one is for the idle thread, which must run at the lowest
priority, and be the only thread at that priority.
