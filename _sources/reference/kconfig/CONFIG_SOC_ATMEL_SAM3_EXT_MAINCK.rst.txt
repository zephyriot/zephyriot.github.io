The main clock is being used to drive the PLL, and
thus driving the processor clock.

Says y if you want to use external crystal oscillator
to drive the main clock. Note that this adds about
a second to boot time, as the crystal needs to
stabilize after power-up.

The crystal used here can be from 3 to 20 MHz.

Says n here will use the internal fast RC oscillator
running at 12 MHz.
