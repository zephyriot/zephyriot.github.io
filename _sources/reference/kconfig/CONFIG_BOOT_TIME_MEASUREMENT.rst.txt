This option enables the recording of timestamps during system start
up. The global variable __start_tsc records the time kernel begins
executing, while __main_tsc records when main() begins executing,
and __idle_tsc records when the CPU becomes idle. All values are
recorded in terms of CPU clock cycles since system reset.
