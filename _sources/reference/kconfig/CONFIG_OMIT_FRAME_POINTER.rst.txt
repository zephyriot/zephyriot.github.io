.. _CONFIG_OMIT_FRAME_POINTER:

Prevent the compiler from putting the stack frame pointer into a
register. Saves a few instructions in function prologues/epilogues and
frees up a register for general-purpose use, which can provide good
performance improvements on register-constrained architectures like
x86. Omitting frame pointers impedes debugging as local variables are
harder to locate and it is much more difficult to produce a stack
trace. Recommended only for production builds which do not need to be
debugged.
