.. title:: NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES

.. option:: CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES:
.. _CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES:

Number of cooperative priorities configured in the system. Gives access
to priorities:

        K_PRIO_COOP(0) to K_PRIO_COOP(CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES - 1)

or seen another way, priorities:

        -CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES to -1

This can be set to zero to disable cooperative scheduling. Cooperative
threads always preempt preemptible threads.

Each priority requires an extra 8 bytes of RAM. Each set of 32 extra
total priorities require an extra 4 bytes and add one possible
iteration to loops that search for the next thread to run.

The total number of priorities is

   NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES + NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES + 1

The extra one is for the idle thread, which must run at the lowest
priority, and be the only thread at that priority.
