.. _CONFIG_NET_NBUF_DATA_SIZE:

This value tells what is the size of the data fragment that is
received from the network.
Example: For IEEE 802.15.4, the network packet is 127 bytes long,
which leaves in worst case 81 bytes for user data (MTU).
In order to be able to receive at least full IPv6 packet which
has a size of 1280 bytes, the one should allocate 16 fragments here.
