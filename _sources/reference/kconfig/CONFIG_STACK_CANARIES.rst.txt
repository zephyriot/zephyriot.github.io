.. title:: STACK_CANARIES

.. option:: CONFIG_STACK_CANARIES:
.. _CONFIG_STACK_CANARIES:

This option enables compiler stack canaries support kernel functions.

If stack canaries are supported by the compiler, it will emit
extra code that inserts a canary value into the stack frame when
a function is entered and validates this value upon exit.
Stack corruption (such as that caused by buffer overflow) results
in a fatal error condition for the running entity.
Enabling this option can result in a significant increase
in footprint and an associated decrease in performance.

If stack canaries are not supported by the compiler, enabling this
option has no effect.
