Supports Bluetooth ICs using SPI as the communication protocol.
HCI packets are sent and received as single Byte transferrs,
prepended after a known header.  Headers may vary per device, so
additional platform specific knowlege may need to be added as
devices are.  Current driver supports; ST X-NUCLEO BLE series.
