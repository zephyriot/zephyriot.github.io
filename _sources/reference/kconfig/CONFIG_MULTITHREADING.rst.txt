If disabled, only the main thread is available, so a main() function
must be provided. Interrupts are available. Kernel objects will most
probably not behave as expected, especially with regards to pending,
since the main thread cannot pend, it being the only thread in the
system.

Many drivers and subsystems will not work with this option; use only
when you REALLY know what you are doing.
